** TODO Get Castlevania running
   NMI timing might be the issue here. My emulator enters NMI earlier than Nintendulator 
   does, and thus skips some code that may affect the NMI routine. In NMI, everything
   seems to be peachy until some incorrect value is LDA'd from memory. Then, stuff happens.

** TODO Fix 8x16 sprites
   The upper 8x8 seems to be good, but the lower 8x8 is wrong pattern, wrong colors

** TODO Fix Mario's background
   The sky should not be black. Mario adventures under a blue sky.

   11/19/2012 - Started working on this
     Turns out that the palettes themselves are being set incorrectly. They should be 0x22 
     for blue sky. I suspect a timing error, but I don't know for sure.

     I have been using [[http://web.textfiles.com/games/ppu.txt][this file]] as a reference for PPU timing. So far, I can't find what's
     wrong.
