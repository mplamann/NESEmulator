Ppu will work like:

12 PPU cycles = 1 CPU cycle


** What is the smallest chunk of PPU time that I wish to work with? **
 - 1 cycle
   * Difficult to work with - very little happens per cycle
   * Most accurate, probs
 - 1 scanline
   * Easier to work with - draw one line at a time, VBlank can be measured in scanlines
   * Does stuff get updated mid-scanline?
 - 1 frame
   * Just no.



NESEmulator.cpp:

while (!done)
{

cpu->runinstruction();

int targetPpuCycles = 12*cpu->getCycles();

while (ppu->getCycles() < targetPpuCycles)
{
ppu->doScanline();
}

}
