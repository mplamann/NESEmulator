To compile and install FCE Ultra, follow these steps:
  1.  Ensure that SCons and SDL are installed on your system.
    On an ubuntu/debian system, run:
      sudo apt-get install scons libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian-esd 
  2.  Enable options you would like to enable in SConstruct file (GUI and AVI creation disabled by default)
  3.  Run "scons" to build fceux.
  4.  To install on Linux/BSD run "scons install" as root.

Users of Microsoft Visual Studio can use the solution files within the vc directory.
These solution files will compile FCEUX and some included libraries for full functionality.

CMake, while it can be used to compile, is currently deprecated in favor of SCons.
